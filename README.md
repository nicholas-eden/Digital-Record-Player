Digital Record Player
=====================

A flash music player with the visual of an old school record player.

Takes an XML file of settings and and the song list.

The arm can be dragged to skip forward/backward in a song.

Records move out and in between each song.



View Readme.txt for instructions on usage.

I built this back in college, my first reasonably sized personal project.
