To change the song list for your purposes

Add a line in the Songs container for every song in this format

<song title="your song name" url="music/songname.mp3"/>

You can have as many songs as you like.  You can put the songs in
seperate folders if you like, just change the folder in the url
attibute.


There are two general settings, autostart and continious.
These are in the settings container.

If you want the player to start automatically then change
autostart to "true".  If at the end of the song you want the player
to start the next song in the list then change continious to "true"


This is a flash 8 file and can not be saved as anything previous
version due to the features of ActionScript being used that were
not available in the previous versions.
